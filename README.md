#### Style changes
This repo uses Material Design Icons so if you want 
to change the icons visit [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) and find the desired icons.<br>
*Do not forget to prepend `mdi-` in front of the icon name.*

In order to change colors you can make changes to `variables.css` in the root directory.

## Building and running.

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

Install the dependencies...

```
Copy all of them and paste them directly into your github repository.
Done.
